		 * Check Check whether a user is authorized to access an object
		 * The Check API queries to check if the user has a certain relationship with an object in a certain store.
	A `contextual_tuples` object may also be included in the body of the request. This object contains one field `tuple_keys`, which is an array of tuple keys.
	You may also provide an `authorization_model_id` in the body. This will be used to assert that the input `tuple_key` is valid for the model specified. If not specified, the assertion will be made against the latest authorization model ID. It is strongly recommended to specify authorization model id for better performance.
	The response will return whether the relationship exists in the field `allowed`.

	## Example
	In order to check if user `user:anne` of type `user` has a `reader` relationship with object `document:2021-budget` given the following contextual tuple
	```json
	{
	  "user": "user:anne",
	  "relation": "member",
	  "object": "time_slot:office_hours"
	}
	```
	the Check API can be used with the following request body:
	```json
	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	    "user": "user:anne",
	    "relation": "reader",
	    "object": "document:2021-budget"
	  },
	  "contextual_tuples": {
	    "tuple_keys": [
	      {
	        "user": "user:anne",
	        "relation": "member",
	        "object": "time_slot:office_hours"
	      }
	    ]
	  },
	  "authorization_model_id": "01G50QVV17PECNVAHX1GG4Y5NC"
	}
	```
	OpenFGA's response will include `{ "allowed": true }` if there is a relationship and `{ "allowed": false }` if there isn't.

		 * Expand Expand all relationships in userset tree format, and following userset rewrite rules.  Useful to reason about and debug a certain relationship
		 * The Expand API will return all users and usersets that have certain relationship with an object in a certain store.
	This is different from the `/stores/{store_id}/read` API in that both users and computed usersets are returned.
	Body parameters `tuple_key.object` and `tuple_key.relation` are all required.
	The response will return a tree whose leaves are the specific users and usersets. Union, intersection and difference operator are located in the intermediate nodes.

	## Example
	To expand all users that have the `reader` relationship with object `document:2021-budget`, use the Expand API with the following request body
	```json
	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	    "object": "document:2021-budget",
	    "relation": "reader"
	  },
	  "authorization_model_id": "01G50QVV17PECNVAHX1GG4Y5NC"
	}
	```
	OpenFGA's response will be a userset tree of the users and usersets that have read access to the document.
	```json
	{
	  "tree":{
	    "root":{
	      "type":"document:2021-budget#reader",
	      "union":{
	        "nodes":[
	          {
	            "type":"document:2021-budget#reader",
	            "leaf":{
	              "users":{
	                "users":[
	                  "user:bob"
	                ]
	              }
	            }
	          },
	          {
	            "type":"document:2021-budget#reader",
	            "leaf":{
	              "computed":{
	                "userset":"document:2021-budget#writer"

	          }
	        ]
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}
	```
	The caller can then call expand API for the `writer` relationship for the `document:2021-budget`.

		 * ListObjects List all objects of the given type that the user has a relation with
		 * The ListObjects API returns a list of all the objects of the given type that the user has a relation with. To achieve this, both the store tuples and the authorization model are used.
	An `authorization_model_id` may be specified in the body. If it is, it will be used to decide the underlying implementation used. If it is not specified, the latest authorization model ID will be used. It is strongly recommended to specify authorization model id for better performance.
	You may also specify `contextual_tuples` that will be treated as regular tuples.
	The response will contain the related objects in an array in the "objects" field of the response and they will be strings in the object format `<type>:<id>` (e.g. "document:roadmap").
	The number of objects in the response array will be limited by the execution timeout specified in the flag OPENFGA_LIST_OBJECTS_DEADLINE and by the upper bound specified in the flag OPENFGA_LIST_OBJECTS_MAX_RESULTS, whichever is hit first.
	Note: If you have `and` or `but not` in your model while using ListObjects, checkout the [caveats](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/relationship-queries#caveats-and-when-not-to-use-it-3).

		 * Read Get tuples from the store that matches a query, without following userset rewrite rules
		 * The Read API will return the tuples for a certain store that match a query filter specified in the body of the request. It is different from the `/stores/{store_id}/expand` API in that it only returns relationship tuples that are stored in the system and satisfy the query.
	In the body:
	1. tuple_key is optional.  If tuple_key is not specified, it will return all tuples in the store.2. `tuple_key.object` is mandatory if tuple_key is specified. It can be a full object (e.g., `type:object_id`) or type only (e.g., `type:`).
	3. `tuple_key.user` is mandatory if tuple_key is specified in the case the `tuple_key.object` is a type only.
	## Examples
	### Query for all objects in a type definition
	To query for all objects that `user:bob` has `reader` relationship in the document type definition, call read API with body of
	```json
	{
	 "tuple_key": {
	     "user": "user:bob",
	     "relation": "reader",
	     "object": "document:"
	  }
	}
	```
	The API will return tuples and an optional continuation token, something like
	```json
	{
	  "tuples": [
	    {
	      "key": {
	        "user": "user:bob",
	        "relation": "reader",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      },
	      "timestamp": "2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z"
	    }
	  ]
	}
	```
	This means that `user:bob` has a `reader` relationship with 1 document `document:2021-budget`.
	### Query for all stored relationship tuples that have a particular relation and object
	To query for all users that have `reader` relationship with `document:2021-budget`, call read API with body of
	```json
	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	     "object": "document:2021-budget",
	     "relation": "reader"
	   }
	}
	```
	The API will return something like
	```json
	{
	  "tuples": [
	    {
	      "key": {
	        "user": "user:bob",
	        "relation": "reader",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      },
	      "timestamp": "2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z"
	    }
	  ]
	}
	```
	This means that `document:2021-budget` has 1 `reader` (`user:bob`).  Note that the API will not return writers such as `user:anne` even when all writers are readers.  This is because only direct relationship are returned for the READ API.
	### Query for all users with all relationships for a particular document
	To query for all users that have any relationship with `document:2021-budget`, call read API with body of
	```json
	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	      "object": "document:2021-budget"
	   }
	}
	```
	The API will return something like
	```json
	{
	  "tuples": [
	    {
	      "key": {
	        "user": "user:anne",
	        "relation": "writer",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      },
	      "timestamp": "2021-10-05T13:42:12.356Z"

	      "timestamp": "2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z"
	    }
	  ]
	}
	```
	This means that `document:2021-budget` has 1 `reader` (`user:bob`) and 1 `writer` (`user:anne`).

	                {

	                    "object":"",
	                    "relation":"writer"

/*
  - Check Check whether a user is authorized to access an object
  - The Check API queries to check if the user has a certain relationship with an object in a certain store.

A `contextual_tuples` object may also be included in the body of the request. This object contains one field `tuple_keys`, which is an array of tuple keys.
You may also provide an `authorization_model_id` in the body. This will be used to assert that the input `tuple_key` is valid for the model specified. If not specified, the assertion will be made against the latest authorization model ID. It is strongly recommended to specify authorization model id for better performance.
The response will return whether the relationship exists in the field `allowed`.

## Example
In order to check if user `user:anne` of type `user` has a `reader` relationship with object `document:2021-budget` given the following contextual tuple
```json

	{
	  "user": "user:anne",
	  "relation": "member",
	  "object": "time_slot:office_hours"
	}

```
the Check API can be used with the following request body:
```json

	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	    "user": "user:anne",
	    "relation": "reader",
	    "object": "document:2021-budget"
	  },
	  "contextual_tuples": {
	    "tuple_keys": [
	      {
	        "user": "user:anne",
	        "relation": "member",
	        "object": "time_slot:office_hours"
	      }
	    ]
	  },
	  "authorization_model_id": "01G50QVV17PECNVAHX1GG4Y5NC"
	}

```
OpenFGA's response will include `{ "allowed": true }` if there is a relationship and `{ "allowed": false }` if there isn't.

/*
  - Expand Expand all relationships in userset tree format, and following userset rewrite rules.  Useful to reason about and debug a certain relationship
  - The Expand API will return all users and usersets that have certain relationship with an object in a certain store.

This is different from the `/stores/{store_id}/read` API in that both users and computed usersets are returned.
Body parameters `tuple_key.object` and `tuple_key.relation` are all required.
The response will return a tree whose leaves are the specific users and usersets. Union, intersection and difference operator are located in the intermediate nodes.

## Example
To expand all users that have the `reader` relationship with object `document:2021-budget`, use the Expand API with the following request body
```json

	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	    "object": "document:2021-budget",
	    "relation": "reader"
	  },
	  "authorization_model_id": "01G50QVV17PECNVAHX1GG4Y5NC"
	}

```
OpenFGA's response will be a userset tree of the users and usersets that have read access to the document.
```json

	{
	  "tree":{
	    "root":{
	      "type":"document:2021-budget#reader",
	      "union":{
	        "nodes":[
	          {
	            "type":"document:2021-budget#reader",
	            "leaf":{
	              "users":{
	                "users":[
	                  "user:bob"
	                ]
	              }
	            }
	          },
	          {
	            "type":"document:2021-budget#reader",
	            "leaf":{
	              "computed":{
	                "userset":"document:2021-budget#writer"
	              }
	            }
	          }
	        ]
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}

```
The caller can then call expand API for the `writer` relationship for the `document:2021-budget`.

/*
  - ListObjects List all objects of the given type that the user has a relation with
  - The ListObjects API returns a list of all the objects of the given type that the user has a relation with. To achieve this, both the store tuples and the authorization model are used.

An `authorization_model_id` may be specified in the body. If it is, it will be used to decide the underlying implementation used. If it is not specified, the latest authorization model ID will be used. It is strongly recommended to specify authorization model id for better performance.
You may also specify `contextual_tuples` that will be treated as regular tuples.
The response will contain the related objects in an array in the "objects" field of the response and they will be strings in the object format `<type>:<id>` (e.g. "document:roadmap").
The number of objects in the response array will be limited by the execution timeout specified in the flag OPENFGA_LIST_OBJECTS_DEADLINE and by the upper bound specified in the flag OPENFGA_LIST_OBJECTS_MAX_RESULTS, whichever is hit first.
Note: If you have `and` or `but not` in your model while using ListObjects, checkout the [caveats](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/relationship-queries#caveats-and-when-not-to-use-it-3).

/*
  - Read Get tuples from the store that matches a query, without following userset rewrite rules
  - The Read API will return the tuples for a certain store that match a query filter specified in the body of the request. It is different from the `/stores/{store_id}/expand` API in that it only returns relationship tuples that are stored in the system and satisfy the query.

In the body:
1. tuple_key is optional.  If tuple_key is not specified, it will return all tuples in the store.2. `tuple_key.object` is mandatory if tuple_key is specified. It can be a full object (e.g., `type:object_id`) or type only (e.g., `type:`).
3. `tuple_key.user` is mandatory if tuple_key is specified in the case the `tuple_key.object` is a type only.
## Examples
### Query for all objects in a type definition
To query for all objects that `user:bob` has `reader` relationship in the document type definition, call read API with body of
```json

	{
	 "tuple_key": {
	     "user": "user:bob",
	     "relation": "reader",
	     "object": "document:"
	  }
	}

```
The API will return tuples and an optional continuation token, something like
```json

	{
	  "tuples": [
	    {
	      "key": {
	        "user": "user:bob",
	        "relation": "reader",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      },
	      "timestamp": "2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z"
	    }
	  ]
	}

```
This means that `user:bob` has a `reader` relationship with 1 document `document:2021-budget`.
### Query for all stored relationship tuples that have a particular relation and object
To query for all users that have `reader` relationship with `document:2021-budget`, call read API with body of
```json

	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	     "object": "document:2021-budget",
	     "relation": "reader"
	   }
	}

```
The API will return something like
```json

	{
	  "tuples": [
	    {
	      "key": {
	        "user": "user:bob",
	        "relation": "reader",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      },
	      "timestamp": "2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z"
	    }
	  ]
	}

```
This means that `document:2021-budget` has 1 `reader` (`user:bob`).  Note that the API will not return writers such as `user:anne` even when all writers are readers.  This is because only direct relationship are returned for the READ API.
### Query for all users with all relationships for a particular document
To query for all users that have any relationship with `document:2021-budget`, call read API with body of
```json

	{
	  "tuple_key": {
	      "object": "document:2021-budget"
	   }
	}

```
The API will return something like
```json

	{
	  "tuples": [
	    {
	      "key": {
	        "user": "user:anne",
	        "relation": "writer",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      },
	      "timestamp": "2021-10-05T13:42:12.356Z"
	    },
	    {
	      "key": {
	        "user": "user:bob",
	        "relation": "reader",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      },
	      "timestamp": "2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z"
	    }
	  ]
	}

```
This means that `document:2021-budget` has 1 `reader` (`user:bob`) and 1 `writer` (`user:anne`).

## Example
To retrieve the authorization model with ID `01G5JAVJ41T49E9TT3SKVS7X1J` for the store, call the GET authorization-models by ID API with `01G5JAVJ41T49E9TT3SKVS7X1J` as the `id` path parameter.  The API will return:

	    "type_definitions":[
	      {
	        "type":"user"
	      },
	      {
	        "type":"document",

  - ReadAuthorizationModels Return all the authorization models for a particular store
  - The ReadAuthorizationModels API will return all the authorization models for a certain store.

OpenFGA's response will contain an array of all authorization models, sorted in descending order of creation.

## Example
Assume that a store's authorization model has been configured twice. To get all the authorization models that have been created in this store, call GET authorization-models. The API will return a response that looks like:
```json

	{
	  "authorization_models": [
	    {
	      "id": "01G50QVV17PECNVAHX1GG4Y5NC",
	      "type_definitions": [...]
	    },
	    {
	      "id": "01G4ZW8F4A07AKQ8RHSVG9RW04",
	      "type_definitions": [...]
	    },
	  ]
	}

```
If there are more authorization models available, the response will contain an extra field `continuation_token`:
```json

	{
	  "authorization_models": [
	    {
	      "id": "01G50QVV17PECNVAHX1GG4Y5NC",
	      "type_definitions": [...]
	    },
	    {
	      "id": "01G4ZW8F4A07AKQ8RHSVG9RW04",
	      "type_definitions": [...]
	    },
	  ],
	  "continuation_token": "eyJwayI6IkxBVEVTVF9OU0NPTkZJR19hdXRoMHN0b3JlIiwic2siOiIxem1qbXF3MWZLZExTcUoyN01MdTdqTjh0cWgifQ=="

/*
  - Write Add or delete tuples from the store
  - The Write API will update the tuples for a certain store. Tuples and type definitions allow OpenFGA to determine whether a relationship exists between an object and an user.

In the body, `writes` adds new tuples while `deletes` removes existing tuples. The API is not idempotent: if, later on, you try to add the same tuple, or if you try to delete a non-existing tuple, it will throw an error.
An `authorization_model_id` may be specified in the body. If it is, it will be used to assert that each written tuple (not deleted) is valid for the model specified. If it is not specified, the latest authorization model ID will be used.
## Example
### Adding relationships
To add `user:anne` as a `writer` for `document:2021-budget`, call write API with the following
```json

	{
	  "writes": {
	    "tuple_keys": [
	      {
	        "user": "user:anne",
	        "relation": "writer",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      }
	    ]
	  },
	  "authorization_model_id": "01G50QVV17PECNVAHX1GG4Y5NC"
	}

```
### Removing relationships
To remove `user:bob` as a `reader` for `document:2021-budget`, call write API with the following
```json

	{
	  "deletes": {
	    "tuple_keys": [
	      {
	        "user": "user:bob",
	        "relation": "reader",
	        "object": "document:2021-budget"
	      }
	    ]
	  }
