# Changelog

## v0.6.3

### [0.6.3](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/compare/v0.6.2...v0.6.3) (2024-10-22)

- fix: fix metrics data race issues (#139)

- fix: fix batch check consistency (#131)
- fix: fix data race on TelemetryInstances (#136) - thanks @Kryvchun!

NOTE: `TelemetryInstances` in `telemetry.go` has been deprecated, as its usage is intended to be internal. It will be removed in a future release.

## v0.6.1

### [0.6.1](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1) (2024-09-23)

- refactor(OpenTelemetry): move configuration API into public package namespace (#122)
- docs(OpenTelemetry): initial documentation and example (#123)

## v0.6.0

### [0.6.0](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0) (2024-08-29)

- feat: support OpenTelemetry metrics reporting (#115)
- feat!: support for sending the consistency parameter to the read, check, list users, list objects, and expand endpoints (#117)
- chore(docs): update stale README (#113) - thanks @Code2Life

BREAKING CHANGE:

When the generator converts enums in the open API definition, by default it removes the type prefix. For example, `TYPE_NAME_UNSPECIFIED` is converted to a const named `UNSPECIFIED`. This leads to potential collisions with other enums, and as the consistency type is a new enum, we finally got a collision (was just a matter of time).

The fix for this is to specify `"enumClassPrefix": true` in the generation config. This will then include the class name on the const name, which resoles collision issues. This means any enum value, such as `INT` now becomes `TYPENAME_INT`. The main impact of this is the `TypeName` consts and error codes. The fix is to add the class name prefix as discussed above.

## v0.5.0

### [0.5.0](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0) (2024-06-14)
- fix: correctly set HTTPClient - thanks @wonyx
- chore!: remove excluded users from ListUsers response

BREAKING CHANGE:

This version removes the `ExcludedUsers` field from the `ListUsersResponse` and `ClientListUsersResponse` structs,
for more details see the [associated API change](https://github.com/openfga/api/pull/171).

## v0.4.0

### [0.4.0](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/compare/v0.3.7...v0.4.0) (2024-05-30)
- feat!: remove store ID from API config, allow store ID override per-request (see README for additional documentation and examples)
- fix: only retry on client credential requests that are 429 or 5x

BREAKING CHANGE:

This version removes the `StoreId` from the API client configuration. Instead, the `StoreId` parameter 
must now be passed to each of the API methods that require a store ID. 

**If you are using `api_open_fga.go` directly, you will now need to pass the `StoreId` parameter.**

BREAKING CHANGES:
Note: This release comes with substantial breaking changes, especially to the interfaces due to the protobuf changes in the last release.

While the http interfaces did not break (you can still use `v0.2.3` SDK with a `v1.3.8+` server),
the grpc interface did and this caused a few changes in the interfaces of the SDK.

You will have to modify some parts of your code, but we hope this will be to the better as a lot of the parameters are now correctly marked as required,
and so the Pointer-to-String conversion is no longer needed.

Some of the changes to expect:

* When initializing a client, please use `ApiUrl`. The separate `ApiScheme` and `ApiHost` fields have been deprecated
```go
fgaClient, err := NewSdkClient(&ClientConfiguration{
    ApiUrl:  os.Getenv("FGA_API_URL"), // required, e.g. https://api.fga.example
    StoreId: os.Getenv("FGA_STORE_ID"), // not needed when calling `CreateStore` or `ListStores`
    AuthorizationModelId: os.Getenv("FGA_MODEL_ID"), // optional, recommended to be set for production
})
```
- When initializing a client, `AuthorizationModelId` is no longer a pointer, and you can just pass the string directly
- The `OpenFgaClient` now has methods to get and set the model ID `GetAuthorizationModelId` and `SetAuthorizationModelId`
- The following request interfaces changed:
    - `CheckRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `CheckRequestTupleKey`, you can also now pass in `Context`
    - `ExpandRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `ExpandRequestTupleKey`
    - `ReadRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `ReadRequestTupleKey`
    - `WriteRequest`: now takes `WriteRequestWrites` and `WriteRequestDeletes`
    - And more
- The following interfaces had fields that were pointers are are now the direct value:
    - `CreateStoreResponse`
    - `GetStoreResponse`
    - `ListStoresResponse`
    - `ListObjectsResponse`
    - `ReadChangesResponse`
    - `ReadResponse`
    - `AuthorizationModel` and several interfaces under it
    - And more

You call the API and receive the list of object ids from a particular type that the user has a certain relation with.

For example, to find the list of documents that Anne can read:

```golang
body := openfga.ListObjectsRequest{
    AuthorizationModelId: PtrString(""),
    User:                 PtrString("anne"),
    Relation:             PtrString("can_view"),
    Type:                 PtrString("document"),
}
data, response, err := apiClient.OpenFgaApi.ListObjects(context.Background()).Body(body).Execute()

// response.object_ids = ["roadmap"]
```
