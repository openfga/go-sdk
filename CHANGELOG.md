BREAKING CHANGES:
Note: This release comes with substantial breaking changes, especially to the interfaces due to the protobuf changes in the last release.

While the http interfaces did not break (you can still use `v0.2.3` SDK with a `v1.3.8+` server),
the grpc interface did and this caused a few changes in the interfaces of the SDK.

You will have to modify some parts of your code, but we hope this will be to the better as a lot of the parameters are now correctly marked as required,
and so the Pointer-to-String conversion is no longer needed.

Some of the changes to expect:

* When initializing a client, please use `ApiUrl`. The separate `ApiScheme` and `ApiHost` fields have been deprecated
```go
fgaClient, err := NewSdkClient(&ClientConfiguration{
    ApiUrl:  os.Getenv("FGA_API_URL"), // required, e.g. https://api.fga.example
    StoreId: os.Getenv("FGA_STORE_ID"), // not needed when calling `CreateStore` or `ListStores`
    AuthorizationModelId: os.Getenv("FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID"), // optional, recommended to be set for production
})
```
- When initializing a client, `AuthorizationModelId` is no longer a pointer, and you can just pass the string directly
- The `OpenFgaClient` now has methods to get and set the model ID `GetAuthorizationModelId` and `SetAuthorizationModelId`
- The following request interfaces changed:
    - `CheckRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `CheckRequestTupleKey`, you can also now pass in `Context`
    - `ExpandRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `ExpandRequestTupleKey`
    - `ReadRequest`: the `TupleKey` field is now of interface `ReadRequestTupleKey`
    - `WriteRequest`: now takes `WriteRequestWrites` and `WriteRequestDeletes`
    - And more
- The following interfaces had fields that were pointers are are now the direct value:
    - `CreateStoreResponse`
    - `GetStoreResponse`
    - `ListStoresResponse`
    - `ListObjectsResponse`
    - `ReadChangesResponse`
    - `ReadResponse`
    - `AuthorizationModel` and several interfaces under it
    - And more

## v0.0.2

### [0.0.2](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2) (2022-08-15)

Support for [ListObjects API]](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects)

You call the API and receive the list of object ids from a particular type that the user has a certain relation with.

For example, to find the list of documents that Anne can read:

```golang
body := openfga.ListObjectsRequest{
    AuthorizationModelId: PtrString(""),
    User:                 PtrString("anne"),
    Relation:             PtrString("can_view"),
    Type:                 PtrString("document"),
}
data, response, err := apiClient.OpenFgaApi.ListObjects(context.Background()).Body(body).Execute()

// response.object_ids = ["roadmap"]
```
